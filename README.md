# bank_py

A simple python application developed with the purpose of practising OOP, error treatment, database connection and usage, and code modularization.

The program simulates a simple bank where the user can create an account, deposit, withdraw and transfer money between accounts. 

This is one of the final projects required to complete the course Programação em Python do básico ao avançado - Geek University, which I highly recommend for Portugues speakers that want to get started (and to get deep) in Python.

** This Project requires Python 3.9
